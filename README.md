# 🌍 Global Temperature Trends: A Long-Term Perspective on Climate Change  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project presents a comprehensive **data analysis and visualization** of global temperature patterns to understand the long-term effects of climate change. Using historical climate data, the analysis investigates **temperature changes across six representative countries** — the **United States, China, India, Germany, Brazil, and Australia** — spanning different continents and climate zones.  

The project highlights:  
- **Long-term warming trends** since the 18th century  
- **Post-1970 acceleration rates** in warming  
- **Shifts in temperature distributions** (case study: United States)  
- **Seasonal variations** in warming patterns (case study: Germany)  
- **Country-wise summary statistics** to compare changes  

## 📊 Key Findings  
- **Global warming is universal**: All six countries show a clear warming trend, with acceleration after 1980.  
- **Germany warms fastest**: Warming rate of **0.37°C/decade** since 1970.  
- **Shift in distributions**: U.S. mean temperature rose by **1.27°C** since pre-industrial times, increasing heat extremes.  
- **Seasonal variation**: Germany’s winters warmed the most (**+2.2°C**), while September showed the least change (**+0.8°C**).  
- **Tropical vs. mid-latitudes**: Mid-latitude countries (e.g., Germany, U.S.) experience faster warming than tropical ones (India, Brazil).  

These findings align with **climate model projections** and highlight the urgency of achieving targets like the **Paris Agreement**.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)  
- **Pandas, NumPy** (data analysis)  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (data visualization)  
- **Scikit-learn** (linear regression analysis)
